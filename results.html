        <h3>Question 1: How often do you eat fast food in a typical week?</h3>
        <p>
          According to
          <a
            href="https://plantbasednews.org/news/environment/big-mac-carbon-footprint/"
            target="_blank"
            >this website</a
          >, roughly one Big Mac meal results in 2.35kg of carbon emissions
          being emitted into the atmosphere. The website is dedicated to a
          vegetarian lifestyle, ensuring the accuracy of these references.
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally,
          <a
            href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965262030977X?casa_token=uk41RWig0YoAAAAA:QCB1xTf3ECv85t-uYqlKqqN-81PC6-KGN45tVfRiHBRRYCnYHH_ySUTqQTXM6wcsIQ5EEzhMY3E"
            target="_blank"
            >a research paper</a
          >
          indicates the carbon emissions of eating food at home versus eating at
          a restaurant or takeaway. Considering that food must be consumed
          regardless, the emissions from food eaten at home were subtracted from
          those at a takeaway, resulting in an average emissions rate of around
          1.6kg of CO2 per kg of food.
        </p>

        <p>
          Based on these sources, the average between both values is assumed to
          represent the total carbon emissions for each meal outside of your
          home, which amounts to approximately 1.975kg or 2kg of CO2.
          <br />
          <br />
          Therefore, if you were to order takeaway, once a week, this would
          equate to around 104 Kilograms of C02 being emitted into the
          atmosphere.To put that into perspective, this is the same as if you
          were to drive 937 kilometres in a car!

          website, it says that by using your phone for only one hour a day
          leads to 63 kilograms a year of carbon emissions being produced into
          the atmosphere.

          <br />
          <br />
          63 kilograms is about the same as driving 568 kilometres in a car. Its
          very scary to think about that by using your phone for an hour each
          day over a year, is equal to driving that much distance...

          >
          website, in Europe, if you charge your phone once a day the average
          estimate of carbon emissions is around 0.54kg per year. That does not
          really seem like a lot. I will agree, that as an individual, it does
          not. But this source also shows how much carbon is produced if EVERY
          phone was charging at the same time, even if only for an hour. This
          would lead to roughly 8,088,324 TONNES. And that is only once, for an
          hour. What about if you left your phone charging overnight....

          gives us a rough estimate of how much carbon emissions are produce per
          kilometre travelled. 111g per kilometre. As students, perhaps you
          might not be driving as much as adults, but it is important to
          consider for those who drive to school rather than taking the bus,
          cycling or walking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us assume that you drive or are driven around 50 km each week.
          That is not a lot in comparison to other people who drive, but for
          arguments sake, let us make that assumption. That equals around 2600
          kilometres a year. That is very little for someone who might be
          driving every day. But let us put that into more perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
          2600 km is around 288 kg of C02 per year, which in turn is about the
          same as charging your phone 528 times!

          study sheds light on the carbon emissions resulting from leaving
          lights on, drawing from research in the UK. It suggests that an
          average of approximately 5.75 kg of carbon emissions is generated per
          year if lights are constantly left on. As we have a similar power grid
          to that of the UK, this can be estimated to be accurate to a certain
          degree for Ireland. When applied to millions of households across the
          country, this seemingly small amount of emissions accumulates
          significantly.

            >BBVA</a
          >
          states that an average shower that lasts around 5 minutes has a
          maximum carbon emission of around 200 grams. If one was to shower
          every day, thats around 73 kg per year. According to
          <a
            id="info-link"

            >a study on trees</a
          >, the average amount a tree negates C02 in a year is around 21-31kg
          of C02. For these stats, this would only be 2-3 trees each year for
          all the showers one would have in a year.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, these results for how much carbon is produced for a shower
          only takes into account for a 5 minute shower with a gas boiler.
          Electric boilers cost more and there is always a possibility that one
          showers for longer than 5 minutes.

          states that the average emissions of a pair of jeans is around 15-20
          kg and a t-shirt is 2kg. This is due to how far it has to travel
          around the world and also based on the natural resources, extracting
          them from the world. If you are one to buy clothes often, it might be
          more sustainable to buy second had, to donate old clothes or perhaps
          to shop somewhere more sustainable.

          up a lot if you were to drink 2 litres a day. Therefore the most
          viable option is a reusable water bottle. While they do create more
          carbon emissions to create, they break even around 40-50 refills.
