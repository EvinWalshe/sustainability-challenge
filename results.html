      <h3>Question 1: How often do you eat fast food in a typical week?</h3>
      <h5>Fast Food vs. Food Cooked at Home</h5>
      <p>
        According to <a
          href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965262030977X?casa_token=uk41RWig0YoAAAAA:QCB1xTf3ECv85t-uYqlKqqN-81PC6-KGN45tVfRiHBRRYCnYHH_ySUTqQTXM6wcsIQ5EEzhMY3E">this
          study</a>, the average consumption of Food Away From Home (FAFH), or fast food, is roughly 4.3 kg of CO2 per
        kg of food. Food cooked at home (FAH) is around 2.7 kg of CO2 per kg of food. This results in a difference of
        1.6 kg of CO2 per kg of food between fast food and home-cooked food.
      </p>

      <h5>Carbon Emissions of Specific Fast Food Items</h5>
      <p>
        <a href="https://plantbasednews.org/news/environment/big-mac-carbon-footprint/">Carbon emissions</a> for one Big
        Mac are estimated to be 2.35 kg. The average weight of a Big Mac is 240 grams according to <a
          href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/gb/en-gb/help/faq/what-s-the-average-weight-in-grams-of-a-big-mac.html">McDonald's</a>.
        Therefore, the average carbon emissions per gram of a Big Mac can be calculated as (1.6+ 2.35) = 1.975 kg / 240
        grams = 8.22 grams of CO2 per gram of food.
      </p>

      <h5>Carbon Emissions from Eating Out</h5>
      <p>
        Mcdonalds also claim that all their food in Ireland, comes from Irish sources so all the above calculations
        could in theory be applied to other fast food restaurants. Based on the above calculations, we will find the
        average weight of a general fast food takeway: Fish and chips at <a
          href="https://www.nfff.co.uk/pages/nutritional-info">450 grams</a>. A medium big mac burger and <a
          href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/gb/en-gb/help/faq/how-much-do-small--medium-and-large-fries-weigh.html">chips</a>
        comes to 354 grams (240 + 114). Therefore, we can find the average size of a takeway to be (450 + 354)/2 = 402
        grams. Multiplied by the average carbon emission per gram will then give us an estimate of how much carbon is
        released for a takeaway. 8.22 * 402 = 3.304 kg / CO2 per takeaway.
      </p>

      <h5>Conclusion</h5>
      <p>
        In summary, opting for home-cooked meals over fast food can significantly reduce carbon emissions. While fast
        food may be convenient, it carries a substantial environmental cost. Choosing sustainable options and advocating
        for eco-friendly practices within the fast food industry can help mitigate its impact on the environment.

      <h3>
        Question 2: On average, how many hours per day do you spend using
        electronic devices?
      </h3>

      <h5>Screentime per Hour - by article</h5>
      <p> <a
          href="https://infomineo.com/technology-telecommunication/how-smartphones-are-contributing-to-climate-change/#:~:text=Research%20on%20the%20annual%20carbon,per%20day%2C%20for%20a%20year">Infimineo</a>
        estimates that the average carbon emissions for one hour of screentime is equivalent to 63 Kilograms of CO2
        emitted. <a
          href="https://reboxed.co/blogs/outsidethebox/the-carbon-footprint-of-your-phone-and-how-you-can-reduce-it ">This</a>
        article claims that there are 7.7 Billion phones in use in the world and that there was 580 million tonnes of
        CO2 emitted from phones in the year. From these articles, it states that for an hour on your phone every day, 63
        KG of CO2 is produced per year. I am here to challenge these figures.

      </p>

      <h5>Breakdown of Apple Products' Emissions</h5>
      <p>
        Detailed reports from <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/environment/">Apple</a> provide insights into the carbon
        emissions associated with their products. For specific data on Apple products, refer to the detailed reports
        available on their website. These reports give specific carbon emissions for the usage of the phone, with a
        range between 11-18%. The average of all these phones was 15.56%. These are apple phones and does not count for
        Android devices.
      </p>

      <h5>Phones and Their Carbon</h5>
      <p>
        "<a href="https://profilebooks.com/work/how-bad-are-bananas/">How Bad Are Bananas?</a>" by Miker Berners-Lee is
        a detailed report of the how much carbon emissions are produced from items that are used daily. Within the
        report, it was found that, from phones, ther are 570 Million tonnes of CO2 emissions per year. Very similar to
        what is above, but for arguments sake, we will take the 570 million tonnes.
        <br> <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.CEL.SETS">The World Bank</a> states there is around 8.27
        Biliion phones in use around the world.
      </p>

      <h5>Calculations and Conclusion</h5>
      <p>
        From these sources, we can find the average amount of CO2 produced per year. 520 Million / 8.27 Billion = 68.92
        Kg per year per phone
        <br> 68.92 KG of CO2 for every phone (on average). But, that includes the construction and transport of the
        phone. I am only interested in the usage. So we need to multiply by 15.56%. 68.92 * 15.56 = 10.73 Kg. 10.73
        Kilograms of Carbon, every year for using your phone.

      <h3>Question 3: How often do you charge your electronic devices?</h3>
      <h5>Calculations</h5>
      <p>
        <a id="info-link"
          href="https://www.comparethemarket.com.au/energy/features/carbon-footprint-of-phone-charging/">Compare the
          Market</a>
        gives fairly extensive research into the estimated carbon fotoprint of charging your phone. They assumed a
        five-watt charge for all phones (which is the current standar for phone charging). That the phone was charge for
        one hour, every day. From this, the average amount of electricity used to charge a phone, per year, was 1.825
        kilowatt-hours (kWh). Then, to delve further into detail, they found the emissions factor for every continent.
        For Europe (Ireland), it was found that charging your phone for an hour every day leads to 0.54kg CO2 per year.
        This is not a lot.
      </p>

      <h5>Putting into perspective</h5>
      <p>
        In the grand scheme of things, this might seem quite small, but to put this into perspective how much would
        would be produced if EVERYONE in the world only charged for one hour? Luckily, they provide us with this
        statistic.
        <br>
        This, in total, would equal to 8,088,324 tonnes of CO2 being produced. When everyone has these habits, it
        creates a world with serious consequences.

        Question 4: On average, how many kilometres would you drive/be driven
        in a week?

          href="https://www.seai.ie/data-and-insights/seai-statistics/key-statistics/transport/">SEAI</a>
        gives us a rough estimate of how much carbon emissions are produce per
        kilometre travelled. 111g per kilometre. As students, perhaps you
        might not be driving as much as adults, but it is important to
        consider for those who drive to school rather than taking the bus,
        cycling or walking.

        <br> Oil at 510-1170g CO2 / kWh

        <br> From these, we can find the average a lightbulb powered at 60 KW and fueled by oil (510 for arguments sake)
        and find out how much carbon is produced for each hour it is active. 60KW in kWh = 0.06 kW. Multiplied by 510 =

      <h3>Question 6: How often do you take a shower/bath?</h3>
      <h5>How much a shower produces</h5>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.harwoodandassociates.co.uk/faqs/guidance-on-flow-rates-for-taps-showers-and-baths/">Flow
          rates</a> of a shower can have different flow rates depending on whether the system is high pressure or not.
        For this example however, a flow rate of 15 Litres/min will be chosen. At 5 minutes a shower this ends up at 75
        Liters of water per shower.
      </p>

      <h5>Calculations</h5>
      <p>
        A <a
          href="https://heatable.co.uk/boiler-advice/heat-pumps-vs-gas-boilers#:~:text=A%20modern%20A%2Drated%20gas,when%20it%20comes%20to%20boilers">modern
          A-rated</a> gas boiler will emit 215 grams of CO2 / kWh of heat. Next, we need to convert the volume of water
        (75 liters) into energy used to heat it. Assuming the water starts at around 10°C (typical cold water
        temperature), and we want it to reach a comfortable shower temperature of around 38°C, we'll need to heat it by:
        <br>
        38°C - 10°C = 28°C
        <br>
        Energy = mass of water * specific heat capacity * temperature change
        <br>
        75 litres * 1000 grams/litre * 4.186 J/g°C * 28°C = 8,790,600 Joules
        <br>
        Now, we need to convert this energy from Joules to kWh (kiloWatt-hours), since the CO2 emissions are typically
        measured per kWh.
        <br>
        1 kWh = 3.6 × 10^6 Joules
        <br>
        8,790,600 Joules / (3.6 × 10^6 Joules/kWh) = 2.4425 kWh
        <br>
        CO2 emissions per kWh = 215 grams
        <br>
        CO2 emissions for the shower = Energy used * CO2 emissions per kWh
        <br>
        CO2 emissions for the shower = 2.4425 kWh * 215 grams/kWh = 525.1375 grams

        researched what it takes to create a T-shirt and what it means for the enivironment. For a cotton T-shirt,
        weighing at 175 grams, would equivalate to 8.46 Kg of CO2 being created.
        <br>
        However, this also included the usage phase, which included the washing and drying of the t-shirt, so for ONLY
        buying a t-shirt this would be create 5.29 Kg of CO2.

        <a id="info-link" href="https://levistrauss.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Full-LCA-Results-Deck-FINAL.pdf">Levi's</a>
        Have provided a guide to how much carbon goes into making one pair of jeans. From this it was found that a new pair of jeans from creation until the "end of life" stage, will produce 33.4 kg of carbon emissions.
        <br> 2.9kg for Fiber
        <br> 9.0kg for Fabric Assembly
        <br> 2.6 for Cut, Sew and Finish
        <br> 1.7kg for Sundries and Packaging
        <br> 3.8kg for Transport
        <br> 12.5 for Consumer Care
        <br> However, the consumer care is not essential for this calculation, therefore it can be removed. With that, it is found that by buying a new pair of jeans, it will cost 20kg of CO2 being emitted, all just as you leave the shop.

      <h3>Question 9: Do you have a reusable water bottle?</h3>
      <h5>Re-usable vs Plastic</h5>
      <p>
        <a id="info-link"
          href="https://apps.carboncloud.com/climatehub/product-reports/id/152490668293">CarbonCloud</a>
        is a company that has spent the past 20 years dedicating itself to creating software that calculates the carbon footprint of items. They claim, the 1 Litre PET water bottle (plastic) creates 280 grams per bottle.
        <br>
        In 2012,  <a id="info-link" href="https://apps.carboncloud.com/climatehub/product-reports/id/152490668293">Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable</a> claimes that it only costs 163 grams per 1.5 Litre bottle. 
        <br>
        <a id="info-link" href="https://profilebooks.com/work/how-bad-are-bananas/"> How Bad Are Bananas?</a> states that a plastic bottle is 103 grams.
        <br> So which one is the most accurate? Well that is hard to prove fully, so for this argument, we will assume it is only 103 grams per 1 litre plastic bottle.

      
        <br>
        <br>
        <a id="info-link" href="https://apps.carboncloud.com/climatehub/product-reports/id/152490668293">Nestle</a> carried out a study in 2010 to try and find out how much a reusable bottle beats a plastic bottle? They found that, depending on the material the reusable bottle is made from, creating a reusable bottle produces just under 2kg of CO2. So, by that logic, for a reusable bottle to break even on the "most" sustainable plastic bottle of 103 grams, the reusable bottle would need to be filled 20 times.<br>
        This does not include the life-cycle of the reusable bottle but solely the buying and use of the bottles.
